===========

Styles for the page are generated with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and compiled to the css folder. To edit the styles, you will need NodeJS and Grunt.

1. Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Install Bower. In your terminal/Git Bash, CD to this project's root directory and type:

    npm install
    
3. You're good to go! To compile the SASS, type `grunt sass`, or to watch for changes to the SASS file and automatically recompile, type `grunt watch`.
